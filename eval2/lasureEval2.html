<!--What follows is the essay itself-->
  <p> To develop his knowledge of how academic libraries create their online presence, in this essay, the author will analyze and evaluate the website of the University of Toronto Libraries.</p>
  <p> To determine what tasks a user may perform on the Libraries&#39; site, the author will begin by describing the site&#39;s elements. The homepage features a grid-style layout, as described by Garrett (2011), with a prominent search bar near the top, which can be toggled between the library&#39;s catalog and its website (University of Toronto Libraries [UTL], n.d.g). Below the simplified search bar, one finds panels linking to various library-associated pages and sites, including a list of upcoming workshops, the organization&#39;s Instagram account and donations page, and resources for instructors. Many pages across the site feature a persistent help chat element, as seen on the &quotCopyright resources&quot (UTL, n.d.b), &quotLoan services&quot (UTL, 2022d), and biotechnology research guide hub (UTL, n.d.a).</p>
  <p>Above this, one finds a header section with the Libraries&#39;  (n.d.g) logo and a navigation bar with drop-down menus. The menu that links to the organization&#39;s &quotServices&quot page is labeled unconventionally, though perhaps not incoherently, &quotHelp with&hellip;&quot. This menu contains links for individuals seeking to learn, teach, and research. There is also a separate drop-down menu for finding informational and functional resources, such as camcorders (UTL, 2022c). Yet another menu provides links to various amenities contained within the various library buildings, including study rooms and copiers (UTL, n.d.g).</p>
  <p>These elements, combined with a closed-access policy for the general public, suggest that the website is designed to primarily support academic tasks, i.e., those related to studying, teaching, and researching. Of course, the site also serves the purpose of providing information about the library. Here, as suggested by Garrett (2011), the author will briefly create three personas to provide examples of some of the tasks for which one can use the site. After, this essay will conclude with some reflection on the site&#39;s effectiveness.</p>

  <ul><!--An unordered list of personas-->
    <li>Jerry is a freshman anthropology student who needs to write a research paper. He needs information on the research process and peer-reviewed sources. </li>
    <br><!--Blank line to increase list readability-->
    <li>Terri is a full professor in the chemistry department who was recently assigned to teach a remote course for the first time. She needs audio-visual equipment to record her lectures and needs help locating e-books for the course readings.</li>
    <br><!--Blank line to increase list readability-->
    <li>Larry is an eccentric billionaire who graduated from the university 50 years ago. He enjoys donating to his alma mater and strangers, so he sometimes hides around campus, waiting to surprise passers-by with crisp $100 bills.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With this framework in mind, we see that the University of Toronto Libraries has the resources to satisfy several of each individual&#39;s needs. For example, Jerry could benefit from the pathfinders for promoting general research skills and locating anthropology-centered information resources (UTL, 2022e; UTL, 2022a). Depending on how much support he needs, he might even consider scheduling a consultation with a liaison librarian (UTL, n.d.d). If the final report is to be submitted physically, Jerry might also need to know where the library&#39;s printers are.</p>
  <p>Terri would benefit from the Libraries&#39; (2022c) technology lending service. After checking out a piece of equipment, she may find that she needs it for longer than expected, meaning she would need to renew it (UTL, n.d.g). She should also consult what the library (n.d.c) identifies as its &quotUnique Collections,&quot particularly its list of ebook platforms and collections. Finally, she may feel more comfortable in her new role if she reviews the content the library has produced about copyright issues in remote settings and if she, like Jerry, meets with a liaison librarian (UTL, n.d.f).</p>
  <p>Larry might be interested in contacting the library&#39;s Advancement Office, a link to which is conveniently located in the website&#39;s footer (UTL, n.d.g). Because things may have changed considerably since he lived on campus, he may wish to learn more about the libraries themselves. For example, he may try to figure out where the best locations to hide are by reviewing the site&#39;s &quotStudy Spaces and Carrels&quot section (UTL, 2022b). It might also behoove him to become familiar with the Libraries&#39; (August 2015) code of conduct to ensure that his philanthropy does not cross the line into harassment. In case it does, he may need to contact the university police to assure them that he is merely eccentric. Luckily for Larry, the University&#39;s (n.d.) <i>Safety & Support</i> site can be accessed through a link found in the Libraries&#39; (n.d.g) site&#39;s header.</p>
  <p>Though the site enables all these tasks, the question of how well it does so remains. The author found the site generally satisfactory. The inclusion of a link to the <i>Safety & Support</i> site was seen as both favorable and novel as the UNC Greensboro (n.d.) University Libraries website, the main point of comparison for this report, seemingly lacks such a feature. At the same time, certain elements of the site might have been implemented better at the time of writing. U of T Libraries&#39; (n.d.e) lengthy staff directory is contained on a single page. Consequently, loading it caused the author&#39;s browser to become unresponsive multiple times. Additionally, the elements on the site&#39;s homepage do not seem fully thought out (UTL, n.d.g). For instance, there are three links to the library&#39;s Twitter account, only one of which may be excused for being a persistent element.</p>
  <p>To conclude, the University of Toronto Libraries website enables many of the tasks one would expect to complete on an academic library&#39;s site. While some of its more innovative elements miss the mark, the site seems intuitive enough to meet the needs of most first-time users without much fuss, and returning users will find an array of extra resources to support their academic endeavors. Therefore, the site serves as an effective example of both how to and how to not design a library website.</p>
