  <h4 id="Introduction">Introduction</h4>

  <p>In this report, the author will analyze the University of Washington Libraries&apos; website using Garrett&apos;s (2011) five-plane model of user experience [UX]. This evaluation will highlight aspects of the site that are particularly effective or ineffective on each plane and offer possible explanations for why certain design choices were made, giving special attention to potential influences from other planes as appropriate. In this way, the author will gain a greater understanding of Garrett&apos;s model by using it and informally contribute to the Libraries&apos; corpus of user experience research (University of Washington Libraries [UWL], n.d.d).</p>

  <h4 id="Strategy">Strategy</h4>

  <p>Per Garrett (2011), website design is founded on the strategy plane where one decides how the final product will further the creator&apos;s goals and meet users&apos; needs. Beginning with this bottommost plane, the author was unable to find any publicly available, explicit objectives for the UW Libraries website. However, there is reason to believe that such goals might exist for internal use. For example, UW Libraries does have a strategic plan with actionable objectives, such as expanding &quot;access to and acquisition of interdisciplinary and multiformat resources&quot; (UWL, 2021a, p. 2). Also, the Libraries&apos; Information Technology Services & Digital Strategies department, which manages the website, has publicly affirmed its commitment to the Libraries&apos; values, suggesting that the department is aware of the importance of planning (UWL, n.d.j). Finally, the website hosts several years&apos; worth of user experience studies and assessments (UWL, n.d.d). This demonstrated commitment to institutional self-reflection lends credence to the possibility that a website strategic plan exists, even if the author cannot confirm as much. Moreover, based on context clues, the author can infer what such a plan would contain.</p>

  <p>From the creators&apos; perspective, the website&apos;s primary purpose would likely be to support &quot;the University&apos;s mission&hellip; the preservation, advancement, and dissemination of knowledge&quot; (UWL, n.d.j). This is because the primary goal of an academic library&mdash;and how it ensures its continued funding&mdash;is to support its parent institution, as implied by Evans and Greenwell (2018). The site&apos;s objectives would also likely align with the Libraries&apos; broader goals, including building the information and communications technology infrastructure necessary for a robust open-access program and &quot;technology-rich teaching&quot; (UWL, 2021a, p. 2). Such creator goals would be complemented by user needs that, as suggested by the University&apos;s mission, includes the generation, preservation, and spreading of knowledge or, to use a familiar formulation, teaching, research, and learning (Evans & Greenwell, 2018). As for the specific site elements required to satisfy these broad goals, these will be explored in the following section.</p>

  <h4 id="Scope">Scope</h4>

  <p>Early in his text, Garret (2011) asserts that content&mdash;a website&apos;s resources that fill the role of Buckland&apos;s (1991) information-as-thing&mdash;is supremely influential on a product&apos;s success. In terms of the UW Libraries site&apos;s content requirements, users are likely to need information about UW Libraries itself, such as whom to contact to schedule a library instruction session and when a given branch opens. Related to the latter, Garrett (2011) affirms the importance of establishing boundaries for a product&apos;s scope, and to its credit, the UWL removed content when it became apparent that said content was no longer needed, as will be discussed below. In addition to providing practical information about the Libraries&apos; services and resources, it would also make sense for the site to feature promotional content, e.g., announcements about upcoming events and links to the system&apos;s social media accounts, since libraries can use such efforts to prove their worth to parent institutions (Garofalo, 2017). Finally, libraries are, of course, information organizations. Therefore, an invaluable type of content the UWL site could offer is information about the current availability of specific information resources. Fortunately for the would-be site user, the University of Washington Libraries (n.d.m, n.d.s, n.d.t) site provides content in all these categories.</p>

  <p>Besides content, the Libraries&apos; site must also satisfy certain functional specifications. Per Garrett (2011), this refers to the capacity of a product to help a user to accomplish specific tasks. For instance, if the site&apos;s content is insufficient to answer a patron&apos;s question, they may wish to contact the Libraries. Given modern patrons&apos; widely observed preference for rapid service, it would behoove the library system to offer a tool enabling rapid communication between the system and its patrons (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, 2022). For this reason, the site has a 24/7 help chat feature (UWL, n.d.c).</p>

  <p>Returning to an earlier example, a patron may wish to reserve an item they have discovered in the online catalog. Both searching for and reserving materials are tasks that, in a sense, the site supports through its online public access catalog [OPAC] (UW Libraries Search, n.d.). It should be noted that properly speaking, the OPAC is not part of the Libraries&apos; website; however, because of the intimate affiliation this site shares with the UW Libraries, it would not be altogether unreasonable to say that it is a UWL site in its own right. As a patron checks out and returns materials, it may become necessary for them to perform tasks, e.g., renewing loans and paying fines, to remain in good standing with the Libraries. Fittingly, one can access their patron account from the homepage (UWL, n.d.t).</p>

  <p>Because the UW Libraries site satisfies all the content and functional requirements listed above, one might consider the website effective. However, there is nothing to preclude the existence of other required elements that, because they are not satisfied by the site, remain unidentified by the author. For example, the University of Toronto Libraries&apos; website contains a quick link to a site where one can find contact information for several support services, including campus security (University of Toronto Libraries, n.d.). While this may be outside the desired scope for the UW Libraries site, it is impossible to say so definitively without the kind of planning documentation discussed in the preceding section. For that reason, this section focused primarily on the kinds of features that are universally expected of academic library websites.</p>

  <h4 id="Structure">Structure</h4>

  <p>In keeping with Garrett&apos;s (2011) conception of structural design, in this section, the author will discuss the UW Libraries site&apos;s interaction design and information architecture.</p>

  <p>Concerning interaction design, the author found that the site relies heavily on text-based error handling. For example, the website has a &quot;Known Issues and Bugs&quot; page, a quick link for which is in the federated search section on the homepage (UWL, n.d.t, 2022a). Likewise, the &quot;Off-Campus Access & Technical Support&quot; page warns about tech issues as a preventive measure (UWL, n.d.n). The effectiveness of this method of error handling is limited since individuals typically visit websites with predetermined objectives, as noted by Krug (2014). This means that a user is unlikely to review the content on these pages until they need it. Even so, these pages could provide a degree of comfort&mdash;if not a solution&mdash;to one who has encountered site issues since the presence of these pages demonstrates that the site creators are at least aware of the needs of users. Taking this a step further, if a patron becomes unable to access digital materials due to authentication issues, the Libraries (UWL, n.d.h) has promised to provide them with sufficient materials until the problems are resolved. Ultimately, while these are not perfect solutions, they still represent a form of error handling.</p>

  <p>The author also perceived that the Libraries&apos; site relies on what may be thought of as, to use Garrett&apos;s (2011) terminology, &quot;conventional&quot; conceptual models. For instance, to schedule an appointment with a reference librarian, one must select a date from a digital calendar (UWL, n.d.k). Because this task might seem banal to many site users, it is worth pointing out that even this everyday digital activity requires certain foundational knowledge and the ability to reason abstractly from that. Namely, one must know the purpose of a calendar, i.e., tracking the passage of days and events, and be able to visually recognize one based on a set of visual cues, e.g., a grid of thirty-odd boxes arranged in seven columns with the name of a month at the top. Similarly, the site&apos;s help chat feature presupposes familiarity with instant messaging [IM] as an activity. Without a conception of IM, a potential user would have no reason to suspect that the chat service behaves differently than, say, an email interface. Because the site uses such time-tested methods, the author characterizes it as conventional.</p>

  <p>As for the site&apos;s information architecture, the author senses that this is heavily influenced by what has historically been convenient for student users, as opposed to adhering to a strict hierarchy of rigidly defined, mutually exclusive nodes, as described by Garrett (2011). This is exemplified by the main navigation bar whose elements include &quot;Start Your Research,&quot; &quot;Use the Libraries,&quot; &quot;Help & Support,&quot; and &quot;About&quot; (UWL, n.d.t). As might be supposed, the first of these leads to a page designed to help one find primary and secondary sources for research (UWL, n.d.r). While the centralization of potential sources might be useful for researchers at any level, other elements on the page suggest a decidedly less-experienced target audience. For example, the page contains links to resources to help one learn to evaluate information, not to mention an &quot;Undergraduate Researcher Tutorial&quot; (UWL, n.d.r).</p>

  <p>Other pages also suggest that the site is organized principally for the convenience of the University&apos;s undergraduate population. Consider, for instance, the &quot;Open Scholarship Commons&quot; page (UWL, n.d.o). It stands to reason that this page would be of greater interest to seasoned researchers than novices since the former are more likely to have publication as a project&apos;s end goal, as opposed to credit for an academic course. Even though the OSC initiative is about research, it is not linked on the &quot;Start Your Research&quot; page (UWL, n.d.r). Rather, one finds it on the &quot;Help & Support&quot; page, along with other resources designed for instructors and graduate students (UWL, n.d.i). Granted, this point is undermined because the &quot;Help & Support&quot; page also contains a link to writing support, a type of resource that is often marketed toward undergraduates (UWL, n.d.i). These resources may not be listed on the &quot;Start Your Research&quot; page because writing, and, more especially, publishing are topics better discussed well after one has started a research project. However, when considered alongside the other evidence, it is equally reasonable to believe that this organizational decision was made based on the site&apos;s anticipated audience.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Frequently Asked Questions [FAQ] pages further support the author&apos;s belief that the site&apos;s information architecture prioritizes undergraduate convenience. Though the purpose of a FAQ page is to consolidate common questions and their answers, as noted by Garrett (2011), the UW Libraries site has two main FAQ hubs, in addition to minor ones, such as that of the Health Sciences Library (UWL, 2021c). The main ones, which the author shall call &quot;FAQ 1&quot; and &quot;FAQ 2&quot; for clarity, are respectively about 1) remote access and technical support and 2) &quot;using the Libraries and information resources&quot; (UWL, n.d.h, 2022b).</p>

  <p>Though the concerns of the former page could logically be grouped within those of the latter, FAQ 2 noticeably focuses on topics related to research literacy, such as &quot;How do I know if my sources are credible/reliable?&quot; and &quot;How do I find full-text scholarly articles in my subject?&quot; (UWL, 2022b, side menu). Furthermore, while FAQ 1 is a standard webpage, FAQ 2 is formatted as a research guide and is nested within the corresponding section of the site (UWL, n.d.h, 2022b). This is significant because the site privileges the research-centric FAQ 2, as demonstrated by two links. First, there is a quick link to FAQ 2 near the search box on the site&apos;s homepage (UWL, n.d.t). Second, while both FAQ sections can be accessed through the &quot;Help & Support&quot; page, it takes two more clicks to navigate to FAQ 1 than FAQ 2 (UWL, n.d.i). Thus, this privileging of entry-level research-centric content, together with the above examples, leads the author to conclude that the site&apos;s information architecture is designed for the convenience of undergraduates.</p>

  <p>To summarize this section, the UW Libraries site provides ample opportunity for structural analysis, as modeled by Garrett (2011). The author has argued the site&apos;s information architecture demonstrates a strong commitment to the needs of novice researchers. Additionally, the site contains elements to prevent and remedy errors, albeit through user-driven, and potentially goodwill-draining, means (Krug, 2014). Finally, the author provided examples of how the site adheres to conventional conceptual models. However, as will be discussed in the final section, the site does break from some established norms to uncertain effect.</p>

  <h4 id="Skeleton">Skeleton</h4>

  <p>In this section devoted to Garrett&apos;s (2011) skeleton plane, the author will analyze the site&apos;s information, interface, and navigation designs.</p>

  <p>Beginning with information design, past user experience studies conducted by the Libraries reveal this has been an area of difficulty for the institution. While studying perceptions of the homepage&apos;s quick-link tiles, one team found that the tile most participants would have removed was &quot;Teaching Support&quot; (Chung & Ionescu, 2021, p. 5). One reason participants disliked this element was ignorance of its purpose and target audience, exemplified by one participant who assumed it was for tutoring. Granted, this confusion may have been overrepresented in the study&apos;s findings since most participants were undergraduates, i.e., individuals outside the link&apos;s intended audience. However, if well-written, a link&apos;s description should be sufficiently informative such that an individual outside the target audience could at least recognize the link&apos;s irrelevance to their own information needs. To the Libraries&apos; credit, archived images of the homepage reveal that the tile&apos;s description was reworded after the study was published, presumably to make it more widely intelligible (UWL, 2021b).</p>

  <p>Likewise, another study inspired significant changes to the homepage&apos;s layout. During the pandemic, the homepage featured a section detailing which Libraries sites and services were available on a given day (UWL, 2021b). However, as the pandemic progressed, a group of researchers found that site users ceased to find the availability updates useful (Rosette-Tavares & Tawato, 2021). Therefore, this section of the homepage was removed, resulting in the significantly more scannable current page.</p>

  <p>The site&apos;s interface design is functional yet largely unremarkable, likely resulting from the noted commitment to conventions. It relies heavily on color to indicate which elements are interactable. For example, both the main federated search section and the &quot;Accessibility at the Libraries&quot; page use file folder-style tabs that change color depending on which tab one is viewing (UWL, n.d.a, n.d.t). However, there are a few instances when it is unclear if an element is functional, as demonstrated by the &quot;UW Libraries Search logo,&quot; located in the federated search box on the homepage (UWL, n.d.t). This element is solely decorative, but several factors might lead one to suspect otherwise. For example, the University&apos;s logo in the upper-right corner is interactable, and when hovered over, the Search logo is revealed to have an alternative text. Moreover, the logo includes an image of a magnifying glass, a symbol that is sometimes used to launch a keyword search after one has entered search terms. Because the element has no functionality, attempting to click it causes no ill effects; however, as asserted by Krug (2014), elements that cause even minor discomfort or confusion for the user can lead the latter to abandon the site for a competitor.</p>

  <p>Like its interface design, the site&apos;s navigation design is generally acceptable, though it might be yet improved. In-text links are typically emphasized through bolding and high-contrast coloration, as demonstrated on the site&apos;s &quot;Printing, Scanning & Copying Services&quot; page (UWL, n.d.p). However, in the author&apos;s experience, inconsistent formatting of text between pages can lead to confusion. For example, the &quot;Accessibility Progress at the Libraries&quot; and &quot;Libraries & Hours&quot; pages feature text that is the same color and typeface and is noticeably larger than the surrounding text, yet only the text on the latter page is linked (UWL, n.d.b, n.d.l). While this inconsistency would likely go unnoticed by most users, it still represents a potential stumbling block, and thus, non-optimal design.</p>

  <p>For another example of poor navigational design, which may overlap with poor information design, let us consider the site&apos;s &quot;Using the Libraries&quot; page (UWL, n.d.u). This page contains links based on common types of academic library users, such as &quot;Faculty/Staff&quot; and &quot;Undergraduate Students.&quot; Though eleven distinct patron categories are listed, only four patron-type groups are represented with a linked image to accompany the linked category name. Here, the author uses the phrase &quot;patron-type groups&quot; because two distinct patron categories, &quot;Alumni and Visitors,&quot; are represented by a single image. This is not ideal for two main reasons (UWL, n.d.u).</p>

  <p><img src="usingTheLibraries.jpg" alt="This is a screenshot of the site's services page." style="float: left;"></p> <!--Link to a screenshot that floats to the left of accompanying text-->

  <p>First, by itself, the image of a laughing woman that is associated with both visitors and alumni might be interpreted as a purely decorative image (UWL, n.d.u). That is, the image&apos;s content is not meant to provide any information about the groups it represents; it only exists to liven up the page and serve as a link. However, the author suspects that the other three images are not intended to be neutral in their content. On the contrary, the content of the image may be meant to be decorative and functional, quickly suggesting to the site user for whom each link exists. The author hopes that he is mistaken in this, for if he is correct, this would suggest that the UW Libraries either intentionally or unintentionally visually coded the links, evoking stereotypes about the appearance of a typical patron from each category (UWL, n.d.u).</p>

  <p>Regardless of the actual demographics of each patron category at the UW Libraries (UWL, n.d.u), this graphical shorthand could be alienating for anyone who belongs to a patron category but whose appearance does not fit the mold. For instance, using an image of two people who appear to be in their early 20s to represent undergraduates may leave an adult learner going back to school for their bachelor&apos;s degree feeling estranged. The same could be said for faculty members who are women and/or People of Color and who see all employees represented by an elderly, White gentleman, whose various identities have historically been associated with privilege in academia (Smale, 2020). Of course, there is every possibility that the author read too much into a coincidence. If not, then these coded images represent not only very poor taste on the part of the page&apos;s creator but also poor information design since, as stated above, the image associated with visitors and alumni does not seem to evoke any stereotypes about either subgroup. That is, an element that was meant to be informational failed to achieve that purpose, representing not only poor informational design but also internal inconsistency (UWL, n.d.u).</p>

  <p>Second, while the other three images are linked to the same page as their respective group&apos;s name, the image associated with the visitors and alumni pairing is linked to only one of its two subgroups&apos; pages (UWL, n.d.u). As has been the case with several of the site elements discussed in this report, on a practical level, this is not a catastrophic flaw. At worst, it might require a user to navigate back one page after initially going to the wrong one. Even so, as with the other examples, there is always the possibility that this confusing navigational element could be a site user&apos;s final straw, costing the Libraries further site traffic and perhaps all forms of patronage from that individual. Thus, in keeping with Krug&apos;s (2014) suggestions, a better navigational element should be created, one that minimizes the risk of upsetting users.</p>

  <p>As stated at the beginning of this section, concerns related to the skeleton plane have given the UW Libraries trouble. While few of the issues discussed are egregious, and none are unfixable, they were sufficiently obvious to the author&apos;s inexperienced eye to indicate that they might pose problems for other users. However, as further reiteration would only be redundant, the author now turns to the surface plane.</p>

  <h4 id="Surface">Surface</h4>

  <p>As discussed by Garrett (2011), the highest plane concerns a product&apos;s sensory design. In the case of the UW Libraries website, the sensory design is almost exclusively visual, with two notable exceptions. First, the help chat interface plays an audible notification when a message is received, enabling a user to communicate without requiring them to focus on the interface while waiting for a response (UWL, n.d.c). Additionally, the Libraries has produced video content, covering topics such as citation management (UWL, n.d.e). However, as these are not all accessible to the public, the author can only speculate that they might be comparatively more valuable for auditory learners.</p>

  <p>In terms of the site&apos;s visual appeal, the author finds it sufficient. The Libraries&apos; site seems to consistently employ the University&apos;s main brand colors, the same purple and gold used for this report, as well as the prescribed typefaces (University of Washington, n.d.a, n.d.b). As noted by Garrett (2011), when a brand exhibits external consistency across multiple products, e.g., multiple university websites, this can create a positive feeling in the user. Additionally, as hinted at in the preceding section, the website typically exhibits high contrast between its content and the white background, promoting readability. Even when a section&apos;s background is not white, individual elements may have their own backgrounds, helping them stand out. This is best exemplified by the search box on the homepage, located in front of a full-color photograph (UWL, n.d.t).</p>

  <p>Also concerning consistency, the Libraries might improve its site&apos;s surface-level appeal by promoting greater internal consistency between the various branches&apos; pages. For example, where the Undergraduate Library displays links to its social media accounts, the Drama Library has a link to the University&apos;s fundraising site (UWL, n.d.f, n.d.m). The page of the Friday Harbor Library, which supports a marine sciences lab of the same name, also features a link to the fundraising site, albeit on the other side of the screen (UWL, n.d.g; Friday Harbor Laboratories, n.d.). It also differs from the other two pages by including a search widget. Finally, the Research Commons page differs from all three of the other locations mentioned here since it employs a button-based interface instead of merely hyperlinked text (UWL, n.d.q).</p>

  <p>Of course, concerns about a page&apos;s layout and navigational elements themselves belong to the skeleton plane, yet the impact that they have on the site&apos;s visual appeal can be its own issue, thus warranting their discussion in this section. Moreover, the differences between the pages might stem from each branch&apos;s respective strategic plan, which would represent this study&apos;s most extreme example of lower-plane choices affecting higher-plane conditions. This might occur if, for example, it was believed that the Undergraduate Library&apos;s patrons would be more interested in Instagram than the average UW Libraries patron. Likewise, the marine sciences library may have a financial incentive to request donations on its branch page if it finds that individuals who visit the page are more likely to donate than those who merely search through the University&apos;s general catalog of potential donation recipients.</p>

  <p>It also seems somewhat unlikely that anyone not engaged in an extensive review of the website would notice the kinds of details described above, limiting the potential benefit of homogenizing the branches&apos; pages. Ultimately, if one counts internal consistency among the highest aesthetic goals of website design, then it seems this site would benefit from standardization. However, if one agrees with Krug (2014) that a little inconsistency can be tolerated for increased functionality, then perhaps the branches&apos; pages are better left untouched.</p>

  <h4 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

  <p>To review, this report has used J. J. Garrett&apos;s (2011) five-plane UX model to analyze the University of Washington Libraries website. In most regards, the author concluded that the site performs sufficiently well; however, at each level, potential areas of improvement were noted. In addition to enumerating the site&apos;s strengths and weaknesses, the author also explained why elements did or did not work and offered possible explanations for why certain design choices were made. While it is unlikely that this study will produce any value for the subject institution, it served as valuable practice for the author, familiarizing him with Garrett&apos;s model specifically and user-experience analysis more broadly.</p>
